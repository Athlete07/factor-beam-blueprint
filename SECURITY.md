# Security Policy & Implementation Guide

## Overview

FactorBeam implements comprehensive security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities and cyber attacks. This document outlines our security architecture, implemented protections, and deployment guidelines.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

All user inputs are validated using the following layers:

- **Client-Side Validation**: Zod schemas with strict type checking
- **Length Constraints**: Maximum input sizes to prevent buffer overflow
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex validation for emails, names, and text content
- **XSS Prevention**: Detection and blocking of malicious patterns

#### Implemented in:
- `src/pages/Contact.tsx` - Contact form with comprehensive validation
- `src/lib/security.ts` - Reusable security utilities

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection

**Measures Implemented:**
- Input sanitization using DOMPurify-style techniques
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Avoidance of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with user content
- Automatic HTML entity encoding
- XSS pattern detection

**Blocked Patterns:**
```
<script>
javascript:
onerror=
onclick=
<iframe>
<embed>
<object>
eval()
```

### 3. Rate Limiting

**Client-Side Rate Limiting:**
- Contact form: 3 submissions per minute
- Game submissions: Limited by timer mechanics
- Automatic cooldown with user feedback

**Production Requirements:**
- Implement server-side rate limiting (recommended: 100 req/min per IP)
- Use Redis or similar for distributed rate limiting
- Configure edge rate limiting via CDN

### 4. DDoS Protection

**Infrastructure-Level Protection (Required for Production):**

#### CDN Configuration
```
✓ Deploy behind Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront, or similar
✓ Enable DDoS protection at CDN level
✓ Configure rate limiting rules
✓ Set up geographic restrictions if needed
```

#### WAF Rules
```
✓ Block common SQL injection patterns
✓ Block XSS attempts
✓ Block known malicious user agents
✓ Rate limit by IP address
✓ Challenge suspicious traffic with CAPTCHA
```

#### Load Balancer Settings
```
✓ Connection timeout: 30 seconds
✓ Request timeout: 60 seconds
✓ Maximum request size: 10MB
✓ Enable slow-start for new instances
✓ Health check interval: 10 seconds
```

### 5. Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Recommended CSP Headers:**
```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; 
  script-src 'self'; 
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; 
  img-src 'self' data: https:; 
  font-src 'self' data:; 
  connect-src 'self' https:; 
  frame-ancestors 'none';

X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

### 6. HTTPS & Transport Security

**Requirements:**
- Force HTTPS for all connections
- Enable HSTS headers
- Use TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2 minimum
- Implement certificate pinning if applicable
- Regular SSL certificate renewal

### 7. Data Protection

**Sensitive Data Handling:**
- No passwords stored (no authentication system)
- No payment information collected
- Contact form data sanitized before processing
- No localStorage use for sensitive information
- Session storage cleared on close

### 8. API Security (When Backend Added)

**Future Requirements:**
```typescript
// CSRF Protection
- Generate CSRF token for each session
- Validate token on all state-changing requests
- Use SameSite cookie attribute

// Authentication
- Implement JWT with short expiration
- Refresh token rotation
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Multi-factor authentication option

// Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- API key rotation
```

## Security Checklist for Deployment

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All dependencies up to date
- [ ] Security audit of npm packages
- [ ] Remove console.log statements with sensitive data
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] HTTPS certificate configured
- [ ] CSP headers configured
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] WAF rules configured

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] DDoS protection verified
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration tested
- [ ] Security headers validated
- [ ] Rate limiting tested
- [ ] Error handling reviewed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
- [ ] Incident response plan documented

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
```typescript
// Implemented in src/lib/security.ts
SecurityAuditLogger.log('event', 'severity', details);
```

**Monitor for:**
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Failed validation attempts
- Rate limit violations
- XSS attempt detections
- Suspicious IP addresses
- Large payload attempts

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Analyze logs and patterns
3. **Containment**: Enable additional rate limiting
4. **Eradication**: Block malicious IPs
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

## Security Testing

### Recommended Tests

```bash
# XSS Testing
Test input: <script>alert('xss')</script>
Expected: Blocked/Sanitized

# SQL Injection Testing (when backend added)
Test input: ' OR '1'='1
Expected: Rejected by validation

# Rate Limiting Testing
Action: Rapid form submissions
Expected: Throttled after 3 attempts

# CSRF Testing (when backend added)
Action: Submit without CSRF token
Expected: Request rejected
```

## Third-Party Dependencies

### Security Audit
```bash
# Regular security audits
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Check for vulnerabilities
npx npm-check-updates
```

### Trusted Dependencies Only
- React ecosystem packages from official sources
- Radix UI components (security-focused)
- Zod for validation
